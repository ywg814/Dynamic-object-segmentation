classdef KalmanFilter
%KalmanFilter Kalman filter for object tracking
%   This Kalman filter is designed for tracking. You can use it to predict
%   object's future location, to reduce noise in the detected location, or
%   to help associate multiple objects with their tracks. To use the Kalman
%   filter, the object must be moving based on a linear motion model, for
%   example, constant velocity or constant acceleration.
%
%   The Kalman filter algorithm implements a discrete time, linear
%   State-Space System described as follows.
% 
%      x(k) = A * x(k-1) + B * u(k-1) + w(k-1)    (state equation)
%      z(k) = H * x(k) + v(k)                     (measurement equation)
% 
%   <a href="matlab:helpview(fullfile(docroot,'toolbox','vision','vision.map'),'vision.KalmanFilter.StateSpaceModel')">See the documentation for the detailed description of all variables.</a>
%
%   The Kalman filter algorithm involves two steps.
%      - Predict: Using the previous states to predict the current state.
%      - Correct, also known as update: Using the current measurement, 
%           such as the detected object location, to correct the state.
%
%   obj = vision.KalmanFilter returns a Kalman filter object for a discrete
%   time, constant velocity system. In this system, the state transition
%   model, A, is [1 1 0 0; 0 1 0 0; 0 0 1 1; 0 0 0 1] and the measurement
%   model, H, is [1 0 0 0; 0 0 1 0].
% 
%   obj = vision.KalmanFilter(StateTransitionModel, MeasurementModel)
%   lets you specify the state transition model, A, and the measurement
%   model, H. 
% 
%   obj = vision.KalmanFilter(StateTransitionModel, MeasurementModel,
%   ControlModel) additionally, lets you specify the control model, B.
% 
%   obj = vision.KalmanFilter(..., Name, Value) configures the Kalman
%   filter object properties, specified as one or more name-value pair
%   arguments. Unspecified properties have default values.
%
%   predict method syntax:
% 
%   [z_pred, x_pred, P_pred] = predict(obj) returns the prediction of
%   measurement, state, and state estimation error covariance at the next
%   time step (e.g., next video frame). The internal state and covariance
%   of Kalman filter are overwritten by the prediction results.
% 
%   [z_pred, x_pred, P_pred] = predict(obj, u) additionally, lets you
%   specify the control input, u, an L-element vector. This syntax applies
%   if you have set the control model B.
%
%   correct method syntax:
% 
%   [z_corr, x_corr, P_corr] = correct(obj, z) returns the correction of
%   measurement, state, and state estimation error covariance based on the
%   current measurement z, an N-element vector. The internal state and
%   covariance of Kalman filter are overwritten by the corrected values.
% 
%   distance method syntax:
% 
%   d = distance(obj, z_matrix) computes a distance between one or more
%   measurements supplied by the z_matrix and the measurement predicted by
%   the Kalman filter object. This computation takes into account the
%   covariance of the predicted state and the process noise. Each row of
%   the input z_matrix must contain a measurement vector of length N. The
%   distance method returns a row vector where each element is a distance
%   associated with the corresponding measurement input. The distance
%   method can only be called after the predict method.
%
%   Notes:
%   ======
%   - If the measurement exists, e.g., the object has been detected, you
%     can call the predict method and the correct method together. If the
%     measurement is missing, you can call the predict method but not the
%     correct method. 
%
%       If the object is detected
%           predict(kalmanFilter);
%           trackedLocation = correct(kalmanFilter, objectLocation);
%        Else
%           trackedLocation = predict(kalmanFilter);
%        End
%
%   - You can use the distance method to compute distances that describe
%     how a set of measurements matches the Kalman filter. You can thus
%     find a measurement that best fits the filter. This strategy can be
%     used for matching object detections against object tracks in a
%     multi-object tracking problem.
%
%   - You can use configureKalmanFilter to create a Kalman filter for
%     object tracking.
%
%   KalmanFilter methods:
% 
%   predict  - Predicts the measurement, state, and state estimation error covariance
%   correct  - Corrects the measurement, state, and state estimation error covariance
%   distance - Computes distances between measurements and the Kalman filter
%   clone    - Creates a tracker object with the same property values
% 
%   KalmanFilter properties:
% 
%   StateTransitionModel - Model describing state transition between time steps (A)
%   MeasurementModel     - Model describing state to measurement transformation (H)
%   ControlModel         - Model describing control input to state transformation (B)
%   State                - State (x)
%   StateCovariance      - State estimation error covariance (P)
%   ProcessNoise         - Process noise covariance (Q)
%   MeasurementNoise     - Measurement noise covariance (R)
