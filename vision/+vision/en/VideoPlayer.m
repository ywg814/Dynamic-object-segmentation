classdef VideoPlayer
%VideoPlayer Play video or display image
%   videoPlayer = vision.VideoPlayer returns a video player System object,
%   videoPlayer, for displaying video frames. Each call to the step()
%   method, described below, displays the next video frame.
%
%   videoPlayer = vision.VideoPlayer('Name', 'Value') configures 
%   the video player properties, specified as one or more name-value 
%   pair arguments. Unspecified properties have default values.
%
%   Step method syntax:
%
%   step(videoPlayer, I) displays one grayscale or truecolor RGB video
%   frame, I, in the video player.
%
%   VideoPlayer methods:
%
%   step     - See above description for use of this method
%   release  - Allow property value and input characteristics changes, and
%              release video player resources
%   clone    - Create video player object with same property values
%   isLocked - Locked status (logical)
%   reset    - Clear video player figure
%   show     - Turn on visibility of video player figure
%   hide     - Turn off visibility of video player figure
%   isOpen   - Visible or hidden status for video player figure (logical)
%
%   VideoPlayer properties:
%
%   Name     - Caption to display on video player window
%   Position - Scope window position in pixels
%
%   Example
%   -------
%   % Read video from a file and play it on the screen.
%   videoFReader = vision.VideoFileReader('viplanedeparture.avi');
%   videoPlayer = vision.VideoPlayer;
%
%   cont = ~isDone(videoFReader);
%   while cont
%     frame = step(videoFReader);
%     step(videoPlayer, frame);
%     % Continue the loop until the last frame is read.
%     % Exit the loop if the video player figure is closed by user.     
%     cont = ~isDone(videoFReader) && isOpen(videoPlayer);
%   end
%   release(videoFReader);
%   release(videoPlayer);
